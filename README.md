> **SafeExec** is an enterprise-grade, open-source Remote Code Execution (RCE) platform that enables secure, isolated execution of code in multiple programming languages. Built with security-first architecture, it provides Docker-containerized execution environments, JWT authentication, comprehensive rate limiting, and real-time monitoring.

## Why SafeExec?

- **Security First**: Every code execution runs in isolated Docker containers
- **Open Source**: Community-driven development and contributions welcome
- **Easy Setup**: One-command Docker deployment for all environments
- **Well Documented**: Comprehensive API docs and contributor guides
- **Beautiful API Docs**: Industrial-level Swagger UI with interactive examples
- **Hot Reload**: Docker development environment with automatic code reloading
- **Multi-Language**: Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, C#, Go support
- **Queue System**: Redis-powered job queue for scalable execution

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and **Yarn** package manager
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (latest versions)
- **Git** for version control
- **MongoDB** (handled by Docker Compose)
- **Redis** (handled by Docker Compose)

## üü¢ **Contributor Quick Setup**

> **We love contributors!**
>
> **Follow these steps to get started quickly as a contributor:**

### 1. Fork & Clone the Repository

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub first, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SafeExec.git
cd SafeExec

# Add upstream remote for syncing
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vikashkrdeveloper/SafeExec.git
```

### 2. Environment Setup (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)

```bash
# Copy environment template - MUST DO THIS FIRST
cp .env.example .env

# Edit the .env file with your local configuration
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

**Sample .env for local development:**

```env
# Environment
ENV=development
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000

# MongoDB (use localhost for local development & MongoDB Compass)
MONGO_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_PASSWORD=devpassword
MONGO_DB=safeexec_dev
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://admin:devpassword@localhost:27017/safeexec_dev?authSource=admin

# Redis (use localhost for local development & Redis clients)
REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379

# Security
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-for-development
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# CORS
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001
```

### 3. Quick Setup with Hot-Reload (Recommended for Contributors)

```bash
# Complete development setup in one command
yarn setup:dev

# This command will:
# - Install all dependencies
# - Build Docker executor containers
# - Start development environment with Docker Compose
# - Mount source code for hot-reload (changes auto-reload containers)
# - Seed database with sample data
# - Start both API server and worker with live reloading
```

> **üî• Hot-Reload Feature**: Code changes automatically reload containers without rebuilding!
> Your changes in VS Code are instantly reflected in the running Docker containers.

### 4. Manual Setup (Step by Step)

#### 4.1. Install Dependencies & Build Executors

```bash
yarn setup
# Equivalent to: yarn install && yarn build:executors
```

#### 4.2. Start Development Environment

```bash
# Start all services: API, MongoDB, Redis, Nginx
yarn docker:setup:dev

# Or start services individually
yarn docker:dev:build    # Build containers
yarn docker:dev          # Start all services
yarn docker:seed:dev     # Seed database with sample data

yarn dev                 # API only (requires local MongoDB/Redis)
```

#### 4.3. Verify Setup

```bash
# Check all services are running
yarn docker:status

# Check API health
yarn health
# Or manually: curl -f http://localhost:5000/health

# View logs
yarn logs
# Or: yarn docker:dev:logs

# Access container shell (for debugging)
yarn shell
# Or: yarn docker:dev:shell
```

## Development Workflow for Contributors

### Daily Development

```bash
# 1. Sync with upstream
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Start development environment
yarn setup:dev
# Or if already set up: yarn docker:dev

# 4. Make your changes...

# 5. Run tests and checks
yarn test
yarn lint
yarn typecheck

# 6. Test in different environments
yarn docker:test:run         # Run tests in test environment
yarn docker:test:coverage    # Generate coverage report

# 7. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# 8. Create Pull Request on GitHub
```

### Testing Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
yarn test

# Run tests with coverage
yarn test:coverage

# Run integration tests
yarn test:integration

# Test Docker containers
yarn docker:test            # Start test environment
yarn docker:test:run        # Run tests in containers
yarn docker:test:coverage   # Generate coverage in containers

# Manual API testing
yarn health                 # Check API health
curl http://localhost:5000/api-docs  # Check API docs
```

### Debugging and Troubleshooting

```bash
# View logs
yarn logs                   # Development logs
yarn docker:dev:logs        # Development logs

# Access container shell
yarn shell                  # Development container
yarn docker:dev:shell       # Development container

# Check service status
yarn docker:status          # All containers status
yarn docker:health          # Health check status

# Restart services
yarn restart                # Restart development environment
yarn reset                  # Complete reset (clean + setup)
```

#### üîß Common Issues & Solutions

**Docker Permission Errors (`EACCES /var/run/docker.sock`)**:

```bash
# Quick fix - Run the permission fix script
yarn fix:docker

# Manual fixes
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER    # Add user to docker group
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock  # Set socket permissions
newgrp docker                    # Apply group changes
```

**Docker Service Issues**:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker      # Start Docker service
sudo systemctl restart docker    # Restart Docker service
sudo systemctl status docker     # Check Docker status
```

**Container Build Failures**:

```bash
yarn docker:clean               # Clean Docker system
yarn docker:clean:all           # Complete Docker cleanup
yarn build:executors            # Rebuild executor images
```
